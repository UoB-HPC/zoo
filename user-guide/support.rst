Support
=======

The HPC Zoo is run by a HPC Research Group at the University of Bristol as a research cluster.
As such, there is limited support available and any maintenance, software updates, installation of hardware, user queries, etc, are addressed on an ad hoc basis.

If you have any issues, questions or suggestions for the Zoo, please `email us`_ and we will support where possible.

There are no backups of user data, so you should ensure important data is saved elsewhere.
